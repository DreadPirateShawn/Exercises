There are various interview questions that I like to give to applicants, and I'm curious about how many languages in which I can solve the problems myself. Also, I sometimes like to keep sample tasks around for reference.

Re: Interview Questions

1) Write a function that takes a parameter and returns whether it is a power of two.

Restrictions:
* Can only use + - * / %
* No floating point (integers only)

Background:
* J2ME had no floating point, and mobile development historically suffered various other challenges & restrictions. Sometimes we don't get our favorite toys to program with, there won't always be a math library to save us, and creative thinking will always come in handy.

Languages:
* Bash
